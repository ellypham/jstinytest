PROTOTYPE IMPLEMENTATION
  const animals = ['pigs', 'goats', 'sheep'];

  function push(array, ...element) {
    // let elementCounter = 0;
    for(i = 0; i < element.length; i++) {

The push() method adds one or more elements to the end of an array and returns the new length of the array.

PARAMETERS

RETURN VALUE

*/

/*

TESTS
It should add an element to the end of an array.
It should return the new length property of the object upon which the method was called.
It can be used with call() or apply() on objects resembling arrays.
The push method relies on a length property to determine where to start inserting the given values.
If the length property cannot be converted into a number, the index used is 0.
This includes the possibility of length being nonexistent, in which case length will also be created.
